# LSTM Model for Yahoo Stock Price Prediction

This project was developed as part of the "Introduction to Data Analytics" course in the 4th semester at HWR Berlin (Hochschule f√ºr Wirtschaft und Recht Berlin).

Johann Estrada Pox, Tim Hendrik Luhmann

## Project Overview

We implemented a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices using historical Yahoo stock data from 2015 to 2020. The model was developed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Data

- **Source**: Yahoo Finance
- **Time Period**: 2015-2020
- **Features**: Daily stock prices including Date, Open, High, Low, Close

## Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras for LSTM implementation
- Matplotlib for plotting
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Jupyter Notebook for development and documentation

## Model Architecture

The LSTM model was designed to analyze temporal patterns in the stock price data to make predictions about future price movements. We chose LSTM because of its ability to capture long-term dependencies in time series data, which is particularly valuable for stock price prediction.
